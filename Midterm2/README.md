## Directory Structure

- **Midterm2/**: Contains materials related to the second midterm, including PNG and PDF figures and plotting script.
  - **Figures/**: This folder contains figures in both PDF and PNG formats.
    - **PDF/**: The PDF folder contains PDF versions of the figures.
    - **PNG/**: The PNG folder contains PDF versions of the figures fro a quick preview.
  - **project2_plotting_script.py**: This Python script is used to generate the figures stored in the `Figures/` directory. Each figure corresponds to specific computational results of differnet many body methods.

## Notes

- The `.py` script automatically generates both PDF and PNG versions of the plots to ensure compatibility across various use cases.
- The naming convention for the figures reflects the method or concept illustrated in the plot, e.g., `CI` for Configuration Interaction, `HF` for Hartree-Fock, etc.
